# Women in Scientific Computing Mixer and Discussion, SciPy 2013

As in other computing fields, women make up a small percentage of the people in scientific computing. In order to bring together the women at the SciPy conference to aid in building community and to discuss related issues, a mixer was held during one of the evening Birds of a Feather sessions.

Approximately three women attended SciPy 2012. In 2013, there was a substantially higher representation of women, with about 35 women or 10% of the participants between the tutorials, the conference, and the sprints. However, this number is still low, and more elucidating is how the numbers break down by participation activity. More detailed numbers for female participation are as follows, noting that some of these number are exact and some are rough best estimates since demographic information was not gathered from conference participants:
* 1/18 active program committee members
* 1 of about 10 lightning talks
* 1/5 awardees for the plotting competition
* 1 of about 20 tutorial leaders
* 2/13 sponsored students
* 3/19 conference co-chairs
* Authors or co-authors on at least 10 of 120 submissions 
* At least 3 of 27 poster presenters
* At least 4 of 70 speakers
* 1/16 full papers

Soon after arriving at the event, people became acquainted with each other and started chatting. There was a good number of people at the mixer to meet new people but have a chance to meet everyone. There were, all together, 16 people at the mixer: 13 women and 3 men.

Eventually, the group formed a circle in order to have a chance to have a discussion.
